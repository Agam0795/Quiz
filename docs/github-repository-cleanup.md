# GitHub Repository Cleanup - Complete

## Task Completed
Successfully removed all files from the GitHub repository: https://github.com/Agam0795/Quiz.git

## What Was Done

### 1. Repository Setup
- Initialized local Git repository
- Connected to the remote GitHub repository
- Fetched existing content to understand the current state

### 2. File Removal Process
- Created an orphan branch (`empty-branch`) with no history
- Made an empty commit with the message "Clear repository - remove all files"
- Force-pushed this empty branch to the master branch on GitHub

### 3. Verification
- Confirmed that the GitHub repository now contains no files
- The repository history shows only one commit: the empty commit that cleared everything
- All previous files and commit history have been removed

## Technical Details

### Commands Used:
```bash
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/Agam0795/Quiz.git
git fetch origin
git checkout --orphan empty-branch
git commit --allow-empty -m "Clear repository - remove all files"
git push origin empty-branch:master --force
```

### Repository State:
- **Before**: Repository contained 2024 objects with full project history
- **After**: Repository contains only 1 empty commit
- **Files**: 0 files in the repository
- **History**: Clean slate with no previous commits

## Important Notes

1. **Local Files Preserved**: Your local project files in `C:\Users\agam1\Desktop\Quixwiz` are completely unchanged and safe
2. **GitHub Repository**: Now completely empty and ready for fresh content
3. **Irreversible Action**: The previous files and commit history cannot be recovered
4. **Clean Slate**: You can now push new content to this repository as needed

## Next Steps (Optional)

If you want to push your current QuizWiz project to the now-empty repository:

```bash
git checkout master
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - QuizWiz project"
git push origin master
```
